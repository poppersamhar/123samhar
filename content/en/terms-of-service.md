# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

**ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "this site" or "we") welcomes you! 🎉 Before diving into our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using this site, you're not just browsing – you're agreeing to and accepting these terms.

## 1. Quick Intro to Our Services
This site offers users paid subscription content and membership services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interaction, to name a few. Heads up: some content is only for our awesome subscribers.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- You'll need a valid email address and a secure password to register for an account.
- Your account's security and all activities under it? That's on you! Seriously, **don't** transfer or share your account. 🙅
- If you violate these terms, we reserve the right to **suspend or terminate** your account. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscriptions are billed monthly or annually, with costs clearly laid out on the checkout page.
- All payments zoom through third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal) – we don't store your payment info here. Phew!
- Your subscription will **automatically renew** unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle ends.
- **Our 14-day refund policy** allows first-time subscribers to request a full refund within 14 days of purchase if they're not happy with the service. Just shoot us an email at the contact address provided at the end of these terms, explaining why you're seeking a refund. Keep in mind, this is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or for any subsequent subscriptions, payments are generally non-refundable, unless the law specifically says otherwise.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- All original content here is **copyrighted by this site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without authorization.
- Users get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our content, purely for personal learning and reading.
- Wanna use it for commercial purposes or quote a lot? Hit us up for authorization first!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Absolutely no** uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. That's a big no-no! 🚫
- **Don't** use technical means to mass download, crawl, or crack our member content. Seriously, play nice.
- We reserve the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. Peace out!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services anytime, without notice. Just FYI.
- If something beyond our control happens – like an act of God, server meltdown, or third-party service hiccup – causing content to be temporarily unavailable, this site **won't be liable for compensation**. Bummer, we know.

## 7. Disclaimer
- The info provided on this site is for reference only and **doesn't constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.). Don't take it as gospel!
- For any direct or indirect losses users incur from using this site's content or services, this site **is not responsible, period**.

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.
- **Any disputes** arising from or related to these terms? Let's try to sort them out amicably first. If we can't reach a resolution that way, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.
