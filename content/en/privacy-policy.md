*Last Updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy dives into our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your info when you use our service. Plus, it fills you in on your privacy rights and how the law's got your back! 😉

Hey, we use your personal data to keep our service running smoothly and make it even better. By using our service, you're essentially giving us a thumbs-up to collect and use your info according to this Privacy Policy. Cool? Cool. 👍

## Interpretation and Definitions

### Interpretation
Alright, so capitalized words have specific meanings under the conditions laid out below. And get this: whether they pop up as singular or plural, these definitions stay exactly the same. No surprises! ✨

### Definitions
For the lowdown on this Privacy Policy, check out these definitions:

- **Account:** This is your unique key 🔑 – an account created just for you to hop into our service or specific parts of it.

- **Affiliate:** Think of it as a buddy company! It's an entity that controls, is controlled by, or shares common control with another party. "Control" here means owning 50% or more of the shares, equity interest, or other voting securities for directors or management. Family business, kinda! 🤝

- **Company:** That's us! (A.k.a. "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this whole agreement) We're talking about **hubtoday**. Just so we're clear! 😉

- **Cookies:** These are tiny little files 🍪 that websites stash on your computer, phone, or any other gadget. They hold bits of info like your browsing history on that site, among other things. Super handy (for us, anyway)!

- **Country:** When we say "country," we're specifically pointing to California, USA. 🇺🇸 Golden State vibes!

- **Device:** Basically, anything you use to tap into our Service! This could be your computer, mobile phone, or a digital tablet. The more the merrier! 📱💻

- **Personal Data:** This is any info that's connected to a person we can identify or one that *could* be identified. Pretty straightforward, right? 🧍

- **Service:** When we say "the Service," we're talking about this very Website you're on! 🌐

- **Service Provider:** These are the awesome folks (or companies) who process data for us! They're third-party pros we hire to help run the Service, deliver it, perform related tasks, or even help us understand how you're using it. Team players! 🚀

- **Usage Data:** This is the data we snag automatically, either from you just using the Service or from the Service's infrastructure itself. Think of it as stats on how long you chill on a page. Pretty neat! 📊

- **Website:** We're talking about **hubtoday**, which you can reach at `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

- **You:** That's you, buddy! 👋 The awesome person checking out or using our Service. Or, if you're representing a company or other legal entity, then that's "You" too. Got it?

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

#### Personal Data
When you're hanging out on our Service, we might ask you for some personal info that helps us get in touch or figure out who you are. This "personally identifiable information" could include (but isn't limited to):

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? That's the stuff we automatically collect just by you using the Service. Easy peasy! ✨

So, what's in this Usage Data? It could be things like your Device's IP address (like its internet fingerprint 🕵️‍♀️), browser type and version, which pages you checked out on our Service, when you visited, how long you stayed, unique device IDs, and other techy diagnostic info. It's all about understanding how things are flowing!

Mobile user? Awesome! 📱 When you hit up our Service on your phone or tablet, we might automatically grab some extra info. This includes the type of mobile device you're rocking, its unique ID, your mobile IP address, your mobile OS, the kind of mobile browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic bits. Don't worry, it's all to make your experience smoother!

And hey, whether you're on desktop or mobile, we might also collect info your browser sends our way whenever you visit. It's like your browser giving us a quick heads-up! 🤓

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We totally use Cookies and similar tracking tech to keep tabs on what's happening on our Service and to stash away some info. We're talking beacons, tags, and scripts – all to gather and track data, helping us seriously level up and analyze our Service. The tech we might use includes:

- **Cookies (or Browser Cookies, if you're fancy 🍪):** So, a Cookie is just a tiny file that gets popped onto your Device. You can totally tell your browser to ditch all Cookies or give you a heads-up when one's coming your way. But just a heads-up: if you say no to Cookies, some parts of our Service might not play nice. Unless you've specifically told your browser to refuse them, chances are our Service will be using Cookies.

- **Web Beacons:** Ever heard of these? Our Service and emails might have these tiny electronic files called web beacons (sometimes known as clear GIFs, pixel tags, or single-pixel GIFs). They're super cool because they let us count who's visited certain pages or opened our emails. Plus, they help with other website stats, like seeing how popular a section is or just making sure our systems are all good to go! 📊

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" types. Think of Persistent Cookies as sticking around on your device even when you're offline – they're loyal! Session Cookies, on the other hand, peace out the moment you close your browser. Poof! 💨

We rock both Session and Persistent Cookies for a few reasons, which we'll spill below:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type:** Session Cookies
  - **Administered by:** Us
  - **Purpose:** Okay, these Cookies are *super* important! They're absolutely essential for us to give you the services on our Website and to let you use all the cool features. They're like the bouncers 👮‍♀️, helping us verify who you are and stopping any sneaky, fraudulent account use. Without 'em, the services you want just wouldn't happen, and we only use them to deliver exactly that.

- **Cookies Policy / Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type:** Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by:** Us
  - **Purpose:** These Cookies are basically our little reminder system! They just help us remember if you've given us the green light 🚦 to use Cookies on our Website.

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type:** Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by:** Us
  - **Purpose:** These are our "memory" Cookies! 🧠 They let us remember your choices when you're using the Website – things like your login deets or your preferred language. The whole point is to give you a super personalized experience, so you don't have to keep typing in your preferences every single time you visit. Sweet, right?

Wanna know more about the Cookies we use and what options you have? Just swing by our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section in this very Privacy Policy. Loads of info awaits! 📚

### Use of Your Personal Data
So, why might the Company use your Personal Data? Well, we might put it to use for these reasons:

- **To keep our Service awesome and running:** This includes keeping an eye on how our Service is being used. Gotta make sure everything's tip-top! 🛠️
- **To manage your account:** This means handling your registration as a user. The Personal Data you hand over lets you unlock all the cool features available to registered users. VIP access, baby! ✨
- **To fulfill our contracts (aka deals!):** This covers creating, sticking to, and completing any purchase contracts for products, items, or services you buy, or any other agreements you make with us through the Service. We gotta honor our promises! 🤝
- **To reach out to you:** We might hit you up via email, phone calls, SMS, or even mobile app push notifications. Why? To keep you in the loop with updates, cool new features, products, or service info – including super important security updates! We'll only bug you when it's necessary or makes sense. 📞📧
- **To share awesome news:** We love sending you updates, special deals, and general info about other cool stuff, services, and events we offer! These are usually things similar to what you've already checked out or bought. Of course, if you're not into it, you can always opt out. No hard feelings! 😉
- **To handle your requests:** Got a question or need something? We'll take care of processing and managing whatever you throw our way! 💪
- **For business changes:** Sometimes businesses merge, sell parts, or go through big changes! We might use your info to assess or go through a merger, sale, restructuring, or other transfer of our assets. This includes your Personal Data, which would be among the assets transferred in such a scenario – whether we're still operating or part of a bankruptcy. It's just part of the business world! 💼
- **For other cool stuff:** We might also use your info for other awesome reasons, like diving into data analysis, spotting usage trends (what's hot, what's not 🔥), seeing how well our promos are doing, and generally evaluating and sprucing up our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience. Always striving to be better!

Hey, we might share your personal info in these specific situations:

- **With our Service Providers:** We might team up with Service Providers and share your personal info. They help us keep an eye on how our Service is being used and might even reach out to you. Think of them as extended team members! 🤝
- **For business changes:** Just like before, if we're looking at a merger, selling assets, getting financing, or another company is acquiring us, we might share or transfer your personal info during those talks or processes. It's all part of making business moves! 🚀
- **With our Affiliates:** We might share your info with our Affiliates, and don't worry, we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy too! Our Affiliates are like our parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture pals, or any other companies we control or share control with. It's a family affair! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
- **With our Business Partners:** We might team up with our business partners and share your info so they can hook you up with specific products, services, or awesome promotions. It's all about bringing you more good stuff! 🎉
- **With other users:** If you're out there sharing personal info or just chatting it up in public areas with other users, just know that everyone can see it! And yep, it might even get shared publicly outside our Service. So, share wisely! 😉
- **With your "okay":** If you give us the green light, we might just spill your personal info for any other purpose. It's all up to you! 👍

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company holds onto your Personal Data only for as long as it makes sense for the purposes we've laid out here. We'll keep and use your data as much as needed to stick to our legal duties (like if the law says "keep this!"), sort out any disagreements, and make sure our agreements and policies are followed. We're not hoarding it, promise! 😉

The Company also holds onto Usage Data for our own internal analysis – gotta crunch those numbers! 📊 Usually, Usage Data doesn't stick around too long. The exceptions are when we use it to beef up our Service's security, make it work even better, or if the law tells us we absolutely *have* to keep it for a longer stretch.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Heads up! Your info (including your Personal Data) gets processed at our Company's main offices, plus wherever our processing pals are located. This could mean your info might jet off to and hang out on computers *outside* your state, province, or even country! 🌍 Data protection laws might be different there, just so you know.

By giving a thumbs-up to this Privacy Policy and submitting your info, you're essentially saying "Yep, I'm cool with that transfer!" 🤝

The Company is committed to taking *all* reasonable steps to make sure your data is handled securely and according to this Privacy Policy. We won't let your Personal Data zip off to another organization or country unless we're absolutely sure they have solid controls in place for its security. Your data's safety is a big deal to us! 🔒

### Delete Your Personal Data
Guess what? You totally have the right to delete your Personal Data that we've collected, or you can ask us to lend a hand in deleting it for you. Your data, your rules! ✊

Our Service might even let you wipe out some of your info right from inside the platform. Super convenient! ✨

You can always hop into your Account (if you've got one, that is!) and hit up the settings section to update, tweak, or delete your info. Easy peasy! Or, if you prefer, just ping us, and we'll help you access, correct, or delete any personal info you've shared. We're here to help! 🙋‍♀️

Just a heads-up, though: sometimes we might *have* to keep certain info if we've got a legal obligation or a legit reason to do so. It's not us, it's the law! ⚖️

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
Big news! 🚨 If the Company ever gets into a merger, acquisition, or sells off some assets, your Personal Data might get transferred too. But don't sweat it – we'll definitely give you a heads-up before that happens and before it falls under a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law enforcement
Alright, sometimes the law comes knocking! 🚔 Under certain circumstances, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it or if a public authority (like a court or government agency) sends a valid request. We gotta play by the rules!

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might also reveal your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to:
- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
Your Personal Data's security is super important to us! 🔒 But let's be real: nothing on the internet or in electronic storage is ever 100% foolproof. While we pull out all the stops and use commercially acceptable methods to protect your data, we just can't promise it's *absolutely* secure. We do our best, though! 💪

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't for anyone under 13 – sorry, kids! 👶 We definitely don't knowingly collect personal info from anyone that young. If you're a parent or guardian and realize your little one has shared Personal Data with us, please reach out! If we find out we've collected Personal Data from someone under 13 without a parent's "okay," we'll take steps to ditch that info from our servers, pronto. Safety first! 🚨

Now, if we need your consent to process your info, and your country says a parent's "yes" is a must, then we might just ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info. Gotta follow the rules! 👨‍👩‍👧

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links that shoot you off to other websites we don't operate. Just a heads-up: if you click a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to their site! 💨 We totally recommend checking out the Privacy Policy of *every* site you visit. Better safe than sorry! 😉

We really don't have any control over (and can't take responsibility for) the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. They're on their own! 🤷‍♀️

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
Heads up! We might tweak our Privacy Policy now and then. When we do, we'll let you know about any changes by just posting the spiffy new Privacy Policy right here on this page. Easy to find! 📄

Before any changes kick in, we'll give you a shout via email or a clear heads-up on our Service. And yep, we'll update that "Last Updated" date right at the top of this Privacy Policy. You'll always be in the know! 🔔

We totally recommend giving this Privacy Policy a quick glance every so often to catch any changes. Once we post changes here, they're live! 🚀
